* Evil-textobj-parameter
  This is evil version of [[https://github.com/sgur/vim-textobj-parameter][sgur/vim-textobj-parameter]].
  
** Usage
   First, you have to define key(see [[Keybindings]]).
   Explanation below assume that you configured along with it:
   
   For those who familier with [[https://github.com/sgur/vim-textobj-parameter][sgur/vim-textobj-parameter]], this works
   almost the same except ~i2,~ isn't provided.

*** Inner text object: ~evil-textobj-parameter-inner-parameter~

   ~evil-textobj-parameter-inner-parameter~ represents inner text object.

   #+begin_src python
     def foo(bar: int, baz: str, fizz: int): -> ():
             |<---->|  |<---->|  |<----->|
   #+end_src

*** Outer text object: ~evil-textobj-parameter-outer-parameter~

    ~evil-textobj-parameter-outer-parameter~ represents outer text object.
   
   #+begin_src python
     def foo(bar: int, baz: str, fizz: int): -> ():
             |<------>|

     def foo(bar: int, baz: str, fizz: int): -> ():
                     |<------>|
     def foo(bar: int, baz: str, fizz: int): -> ():
                               |<------->|
   #+end_src

** Configuration
*** Keybindings
    By default, this package doesn't provide any default keybinds.
    Rather, you define it yourself.

    If you want to use it with the same keybind as original, you can copy this:

    #+begin_src elisp
      (evil-define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map "," 'evil-textobj-parameter-inner-parameter)
      (evil-define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map "," 'evil-textobj-parameter-outer-parameter)
    #+end_src
** Installation
